# Estimote iBeacons PhoneGap 3.x Plugin for Android

## Overview

*NOTE: THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. IT'S NOT EVEN A BETA VERSION YET. EVERYTHING MAY CHANGE.*

This PhoneGap 3.x Plugin for Android allows interaction with [Estimote iBeacons](http://estimote.com). The requirements are PhoneGap 3.x, Android 4.3 or above and Bluetooth 4.0 or above (a.k.a. BLE or Bluetooth Low Energy).

This PhoneGap Plugin is just a wrapper around [Estimote Android SDK](https://github.com/Estimote/Android-SDK). All naming conventions come from it.

It allows for:
- beacon ranging (scan beacons and optionally filters them by their values)
- beacon monitoring (monitors regions for those devices that have entered/exited a region)
- beacon characteristics reading (proximity UUID, major & minor values, broadcasting power, advertising interval).
